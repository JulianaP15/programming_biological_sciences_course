# Programming for Biological Sciences – Course Projects

This repository contains my assignments and projects from the **Programming for Biological Sciences** course.  
Each folder corresponds to a project where I apply Python to real biological data formats.

---

## 📂 Projects included

1. **[Project 1 – dbSNP Summary Parser](./project1_dbsnp_summary_parser/)**  
   Read and process dbSNP summary files and transform them into tabular format.

(More projects will be added as the course progresses.)

## 🎯 Learning goals
- Practice Python applied to biological data.  
- Learn how to handle **non-tabular biological file formats**.  
- Use libraries for **data analysis and visualization** (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`).
