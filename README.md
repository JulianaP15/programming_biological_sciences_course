# Programming for Biological Sciences – Course Projects

This repository contains my assignments and projects from the **Programming for Biological Sciences** course.  
Each folder corresponds to a project where I apply Python to real biological data formats.

## 📂 Projects included

1. **[Project 1 – dbSNP Summary Parser](./project1_dbsnp_summary_parser/)**  
   Read and process dbSNP summary files and transform them into tabular format.

2. **[Project 2 – METABRIC Descriptive Analysis](./project2_METABRIC_descriptive_analysis/)**  
   Exploratory analysis of the METABRIC breast cancer dataset, linking molecular subtype classifications (PAM50 and 3-gene) with patient age, survival, and therapies.  
   Generates multiple figures automatically (histograms, violin plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and scatterplots).


(More projects will be added as the course progresses.)

## 🎯 Learning goals
- Practice Python applied to biological data.  
- Learn to process both **structured and unstructured** bioinformatics data.
- Develop skills in **data visualization** and **scientific figure generation**.
- Use libraries for **data analysis and visualization** (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `SciPy`, `Statsmodels`).
